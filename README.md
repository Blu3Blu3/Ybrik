The first platformer and first game you'll ever try to make; here's to hoping it goes well :)

The name is pending, since this project is still very much in its infancy, but it's meant to be a play on "Kirby" on behalf of this game attempting to be a more difficult, fleshed-out version of that series in terms of gameplay. It'll aim to have the fluidity of its controls, but combined with the deliberate movement and decision making of harder games like Hollow Knight or Elden Ring.
Lore-wise, who knows; that can come later, but will likely be lighter than the kind of heft that's in those games :P
